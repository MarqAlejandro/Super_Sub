 # super(sub) ordering app 

 ## Description

 This Application is a Multi-Tiered numerically-navigated User-Interface, that allows the user to create customizable meals of customizable sandwiches, along with side of chips and drink.  

 ## Features

 4 main screens - Home, Order, Sandwich, Check-out.
   - Home has 2 options - start a new order, or exit the program.
   - Order has 5 options, 3 of which add an item to the order, 4th one leads to the check-out screen, 5th is back to the home screen.
   - Sandwich isn't a typical screen menu, instead it walks you through the toppings and ingredients.
   - Check out will display the order on the terminal and asked for confirmation of the order, or to cancel the order and go back to the home screen
